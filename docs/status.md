# Development Status - 2024-04-05

This document tracks the high-level progress and current status of the Massage Therapy Booking System, focusing on local development.\r\n\r\n## Project State Summary\r\n\r\n- The project is currently focused on **local development and deployment**.\r\n- Cloud deployment infrastructure (Azure, Terraform) has been removed.\r\n- **ASP.NET Core Identity** has been successfully integrated for authentication and authorization, replacing previous placeholder/JWT logic.\r\n- The backend API is built with **.NET 9** and **Entity Framework Core 9**.\r\n- The database schema is managed via **EF Core Migrations** and targets **SQL Server LocalDB**.\r\n- The frontend is a **React** application communicating with the API via **Axios** (using cookie authentication).\r\n- Core features (Appointments, Clients, Therapists, Services, SOAP Notes, Availability, Admin Dashboard) have base implementations, but may require further refinement and testing.\r\n- **Database seeding** is in place for Roles and a default Admin user in the Development environment.\r\n\r\n## Recently Completed Major Efforts\r\n\r\n1.  **Identity Integration & Refactoring:**\r\n    - Integrated ASP.NET Core Identity for user management.\r\n    - Refactored backend `AuthController` to use `SignInManager`/`UserManager` for cookie authentication.\r\n    - Configured Identity services and cookie behavior in `Program.cs`.\r\n    - Updated database schema using EF Core Migrations (`AddIdentityTables`).\r\n    - Added seeding for Roles and default Admin user.\r\n    - Resolved various build/runtime errors related to package versions, dependencies, and EF Core configurations.\r\n2.  **Frontend Authentication Refactoring:**\r\n    - Updated `apiClient.js` to remove JWT logic and enable cookie credentials (`withCredentials: true`).\r\n    - Refactored `AuthContext.js` to manage state based on cookie sessions (via `/api/auth/userinfo`) instead of `localStorage`.\r\n    - Fixed login/logout flow to use cookie authentication.\r\n3.  **Admin Page Access Fix:**\r\n    - Corrected frontend routing in `App.js` to ensure Client and Therapist management pages are accessible to Admin users and added navigation links.\r\n\r\n## Current Focus & Blockers\r\n\r\n- **Focus:** Solidifying core functionality with the new Identity system, refining authorization, and preparing for further feature development or testing.\r\n- **Blockers:** None currently identified. The main immediate task is to implement user registration (Task Next.1 in `tasks/tasks.md`).\r\n\r\n## Next Steps & Priorities\r\n\r\n*(Refer to `tasks/tasks.md` for detailed task breakdown)*\r\n\r\n1.  **Implement User Registration:** Allow clients to self-register.\r\n2.  **Refine API Authorization:** Ensure all endpoints have correct role-based protection.\r\n3.  **(Optional) Seed Sample Data:** Add sample clients/therapists for testing.\r\n4.  **Address Nullability Warnings:** Improve code quality by fixing build warnings.\r\n5.  **Enhance Frontend UI/UX:** Improve usability and appearance.\r\n6.  **Testing:** Set up and implement unit/integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement\r\n\r\n- Numerous C# nullability warnings need attention.\r\n- Frontend UI is basic and needs styling/UX refinement.\r\n- Automated testing coverage is likely low and needs implementation.\r\n- Data seeding is minimal (only roles and one admin user).\r\n- Error handling and logging can be more robust.
