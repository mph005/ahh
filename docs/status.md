# Development Status - 2024-04-05

This document tracks the high-level progress and current status of the Massage Therapy Booking System, focusing on local development.

## Project State Summary

- The project is currently focused on **local development and deployment**.
- Cloud deployment infrastructure (Azure, Terraform) has been removed.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** has been successfully integrated for authentication and authorization, replacing previous placeholder/JWT logic.
- The backend API is built with **.NET 9** and **Entity Framework Core 9**.
- The database schema is managed via **EF Core Migrations** and targets **SQL Server LocalDB**.
- The frontend is a **React** application communicating with the API via **Axios** (using cookie authentication).
- Core features (Appointments, Clients, Therapists, Services, SOAP Notes, Availability, Admin Dashboard) have base implementations, but may require further refinement and testing.
- **Database seeding** is in place for Roles and a default Admin user in the Development environment.

## Recently Completed Major Efforts

1.  **Identity Integration & Refactoring:**
    - Integrated ASP.NET Core Identity for user management.
    - Refactored backend `AuthController` to use `SignInManager`/`UserManager` for cookie authentication.
    - Configured Identity services and cookie behavior in `Program.cs`.
    - Updated database schema using EF Core Migrations (`AddIdentityTables`).
    - Added seeding for Roles and default Admin user.
    - Resolved various build/runtime errors related to package versions, dependencies, and EF Core configurations.
2.  **Frontend Authentication Refactoring:**
    - Updated `apiClient.js` to remove JWT logic and enable cookie credentials (`withCredentials: true`).
    - Refactored `AuthContext.js` to manage state based on cookie sessions (via `/api/auth/userinfo`) instead of `localStorage`.
    - Fixed login/logout flow to use cookie authentication.
3.  **Admin Page Access Fix:**
    - Corrected frontend routing in `App.js` to ensure Client and Therapist management pages are accessible to Admin users and added navigation links.

## Current Focus & Blockers

- **Focus:** Solidifying core functionality with the new Identity system, refining authorization, and preparing for further feature development or testing.
- **Blockers:** None currently identified. The main immediate task is to implement user registration (Task Next.1 in `tasks/tasks.md`).

## Next Steps & Priorities

*(Refer to `tasks/tasks.md` for detailed task breakdown)*

1.  **Implement User Registration:** Allow clients to self-register.
2.  **Refine API Authorization:** Ensure all endpoints have correct role-based protection.
3.  **(Optional) Seed Sample Data:** Add sample clients/therapists for testing.
4.  **Address Nullability Warnings:** Improve code quality by fixing build warnings.
5.  **Enhance Frontend UI/UX:** Improve usability and appearance.
6.  **Testing:** Set up and implement unit/integration tests.

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- Numerous C# nullability warnings need attention.
- Frontend UI is basic and needs styling/UX refinement.
- Automated testing coverage is likely low and needs implementation.
- Data seeding is minimal (only roles and one admin user).
- Error handling and logging can be more robust.
